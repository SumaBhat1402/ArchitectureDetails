Context and Problem
  Divide a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards. 
  
Solution:
  Divide the data store into horizontal partitions or shards. Each shard has the same schema, but holds its own distinct subset of the data. 
  A shard is a data store in its own right (it can contain the data for many entities of different types), running on a server acting as a storage node.

Sharding strategies
  The Lokkup Startegy
  The Range  Strategy
  The Hash Strategy



Sharding Strategies
 There are 3 types how to divide the data horizonatally.
 There need not to be one to one with sharding and the server.
 Single server can host multiple shards.
