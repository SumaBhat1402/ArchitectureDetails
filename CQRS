What is CQRS?
CQRS - Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, as the name suggests, splits the application in two parts: Command-Side and Query-Side. 
Commands are the ones that change the state of the object or entity. 
They are also called modifiers or mutators. Queries are those that return the state of the entity, and do not change anything. They are also called accessors.
